## Inspiration
I love machine learning but it was just a thing we can only do in python and with our big clunky computer and I wanted to make a project that would bring ML to our pockets natively in dart.

## What it does
It uses machine learning to help our daily lives by helping us find people to borrow from, it scan text with ease, and protect us from bullies all natively in dart.

## How I built it
Dart has tool to process images so I used them to find text symbols with a model that was use from someones else but it was very hard to make it work. Next was sentiment analysis, I had to use .Split(" ") instead of .wordTokenize(). That made alot harder and well as the script to process if it the word was mean or not. I use a list and a for loop to compare values then added and displayed. Much easier said than done. 

## Challenges we ran into
Podfile was the biggest error I faces causing me to waste almost 5 hours of my time just fixing it. I wanted to quit IOS development then. It took a lot of copuim and stack overflow to solve it but I managed to solve it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I was able to do native  machine learning instead of having to do API calls. 

## What we learned
I learned about the power of dart and how much I can do with it. It is a truly powerful language and very safe too!
